# Transformer-based Stock Price Predictor

## Technical Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

**Data Sources to Gather:**

- Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) price data
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages)
- Market sentiment data (news sentiment scores, social media sentiment)
- Economic indicators (VIX, interest rates, sector indices)
- Alternative data (options flow, insider trading, earnings calendars)

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Acquisition Pipeline** - Build automated data fetchers with proper rate limiting and error handling
2. **Data Quality Assessment** - Handle missing values, outliers, stock splits, dividend adjustments
3. **Feature Engineering** - Create technical indicators, rolling statistics, cross-asset correlations
4. **Temporal Alignment** - Synchronize different data frequencies (daily prices, hourly sentiment, etc.)
5. **Normalization Strategy** - Design robust scaling that handles regime changes and volatility clustering

*Tech Recommendations: yfinance/Alpha Vantage for prices, NewsAPI/Twitter API for sentiment, pandas/polars for processing*

### Phase 2: Problem Formulation & Target Design

**Prediction Target Options:**

- Next-day return classification (up/down/sideways)
- Multi-horizon return regression (1d, 5d, 20d ahead)
- Volatility prediction for risk management
- Directional movement with confidence intervals

**Key Steps:**

1. **Target Variable Construction** - Define prediction horizon and return calculation method
2. **Labeling Strategy** - Handle overlapping predictions and forward-looking bias
3. **Class Balance Analysis** - Address market regime imbalances (bull vs bear periods)
4. **Evaluation Metrics Design** - Beyond accuracy: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, hit rate by market condition

### Phase 3: Sequence Design & Windowing

**Temporal Structure Decisions:**

- Lookback window length (30-252 trading days typical)
- Prediction horizon (1-20 days ahead)
- Sliding window vs expanding window training
- Cross-validation strategy for time series

**Key Steps:**

1. **Sequence Length Optimization** - Test different lookback periods for signal vs noise tradeoff
2. **Multi-Resolution Input** - Combine daily, weekly, monthly features in single model
3. **Attention Mask Design** - Handle weekends, holidays, market closures properly
4. **Data Leakage Prevention** - Strict temporal splits, no future information bleeding

### Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Transformer Modifications for Finance:**

- Positional encoding for irregular time series (weekends, holidays)
- Multi-head attention for different market regimes
- Cross-attention between assets for sector/market relationships
- Temporal convolutional layers before transformer blocks

**Key Steps:**

1. **Base Architecture Selection** - Start with standard transformer, then customize
2. **Input Embedding Strategy** - How to encode multiple features per timestep
3. **Attention Pattern Analysis** - Design interpretable attention for financial insights
4. **Output Head Design** - Classification vs regression, single vs multi-target
5. **Regularization Strategy** - Dropout, layer norm, gradient clipping for financial data

*Tech Recommendations: Start with PyTorch's nn.Transformer, consider Performer/Linformer for efficiency*

### Phase 5: Training Infrastructure with Lightning

**Training Pipeline Components:**

- Custom dataset class for financial time series
- Data module with proper train/val/test splits
- Lightning module with financial-specific loss functions
- Callbacks for early stopping, model checkpointing, learning rate scheduling

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Module Implementation** - Handle different sampling strategies (random vs sequential)
2. **Loss Function Design** - Combine prediction accuracy with financial metrics (Sharpe, drawdown)
3. **Optimization Strategy** - Learning rate scheduling sensitive to market volatility
4. **Distributed Training Setup** - Multi-GPU training for parameter sweeps
5. **Experiment Tracking** - Log financial metrics alongside ML metrics

### Phase 6: Model Training & Hyperparameter Optimization

**Critical Hyperparameters:**

- Sequence length and batch size
- Learning rate schedule and warmup
- Attention heads and model dimensions
- Regularization strength

**Key Steps:**

1. **Baseline Model Training** - Simple transformer with standard hyperparameters
2. **Hyperparameter Search** - Use Optuna/Ray Tune with Lightning integration
3. **Cross-Validation Strategy** - Time series CV with gap between train/test
4. **Regime-Aware Training** - Handle bull/bear market transitions
5. **Ensemble Strategy** - Multiple models for different market conditions

### Phase 7: Evaluation & Financial Metrics

**Beyond ML Metrics:**

- Sharpe ratio and risk-adjusted returns
- Maximum drawdown and recovery time
- Hit rate by market volatility regime
- Transaction cost impact analysis

**Key Steps:**

1. **Backtest Framework** - Realistic trading simulation with costs
2. **Risk Metrics Calculation** - VaR, expected shortfall, beta analysis
3. **Regime Analysis** - Performance breakdown by market conditions
4. **Attribution Analysis** - Which features/attention heads drive performance
5. **Benchmark Comparison** - vs buy-and-hold, simple technical indicators

### Phase 8: Interpretability & Analysis

**Understanding Model Decisions:**

- Attention weight visualization over time
- Feature importance through gradient analysis
- Regime detection through hidden states
- Failure case analysis during market stress

**Key Steps:**

1. **Attention Visualization** - Which time periods/features get most attention
2. **Feature Attribution** - SHAP/integrated gradients for prediction explanation
3. **Hidden State Analysis** - Clustering to identify learned market regimes
4. **Error Analysis** - When and why the model fails
5. **Economic Intuition Validation** - Do learned patterns match financial theory

### Phase 9: Production Considerations

**Deployment Readiness:**

- Real-time data pipeline integration
- Model serving with low latency requirements
- A/B testing framework for live trading
- Risk management and position sizing integration

**Key Steps:**

1. **Model Optimization** - Quantization, pruning for inference speed
2. **Serving Infrastructure** - REST API with proper error handling
3. **Monitoring Pipeline** - Model drift detection, performance tracking
4. **Risk Controls** - Position limits, drawdown stops, correlation limits
5. **Paper Trading** - Live testing without real money

---

**Estimated Timeline:** 8-12 weeks for full implementation
**Key Success Metrics:** Consistent positive Sharpe ratio (>1.0), max drawdown <15%, outperformance vs benchmarks over multiple market regimes

This plan balances technical rigor with financial domain expertise. The transformer architecture will likely discover complex temporal patterns that traditional technical analysis misses, especially in the attention mechanisms across different time horizons.
